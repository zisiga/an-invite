      <h1>Dearest friend,</h1>
    <p>
<br>
When you arrive in Kenya, you will be greeted by the rich smell of soil. Words can't prepare you for the amount of laughter, friendly teasing, and the frustration of Nairobi traffic. But amidst it all, you must experience the sheer joy of being welcomed into Mama Mukulu's kitchen.
<br><br>I have been talking about this trip for 5 years, and finally, the time has come. Nothing would bring me greater happiness than having you join me on this adventure.

<br><br> Here's what I envision for our 9-day trip to Kenya:<br> <div class="g-details">
     <b> 26th December 2023</b> | Arrival in <span class="highlight">Nairobi, Kenya.</span>
      <br><b>27-29th December 2023</b> | Exploring the vibrant city, visiting the Masai market, feeding giraffes at the Giraffe Centre, and drinking local coffee.
      <br><b>30-1st December</b> | Heading south to experience <span class="highlight">Amboseli national park</span> and enjoy a safari, starting the new year surrounded by the beauty of Mount Kilimanjaro.
      <br><b>2-5th January 2024</b> | <span class="highlight">Lamu. </span> IFYKYK.
      <br><b>6th January 2024</b> | Our last day (or stay longer) in Nairobi. 
      <br><br></div>
      The <i>ESTIMATED</i> budget for the trip is $3,200. This including accommodation, flights, and some meals. I want to make this trip as inclusive as possible but also understand that this is a lot of money. If you are interested in joining but are concerned about the cost, please let me know and we can discuss options.
      <br> <br>
      Kindly RSVP by July 20th, letting me know if you can make it and which days you'll be able to join. This is just the first step of our planning process. Once we have a final headcount, I'll provide more details and finalize the arrangements. </p> 
    </br> <br>
        <p> Karibu Kenya! </p>
